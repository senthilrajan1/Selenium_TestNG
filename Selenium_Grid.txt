
Selenium Grid:

Selenium Grid allows to run tests on different machines against different browsers.

It supports distributed test execution

 We can run the Tests in parallel in Multiple machines on Selenium Grid.


What is Hub?

Hub is the central point that will receive all the test request and distribute them the to the right nodes.

There should be only one hub in a grid.

Machine containing the Hub is where the tests will be triggered, but will see the browser being automated on the node.




Node: 
Nodes are the Selenium instances that will execute the tests that loaded on the Hub. Nodes can be launched on multiple machines with different platforms and browsers.

Step 1:

"Starting a HUB"

java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role hub



Step 2:

http://192.168.1.11:4444/grid/console

Step 3:

Connect to the Node with following command


C:\> java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role webdriver -hub http://192.168.1.11:4444/grid/register -port 5566

Step 4:

Need to add the chrome driver which helps to configure with the Node. So Need to change the command line in Node.


C:/> java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="C:\SenthilSelenium\Drivers\chromedriver" jar selenium-server-standalone-3-141.59.jar -role webdriver -hub http:\\192.168.1.11:4444/grid/register -port 5566
